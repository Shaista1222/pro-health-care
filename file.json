----------ERRORs------------
1) when name can not destructure from req.body
express.json() middleware to your Express app. This middleware will parse incoming requests with JSON payloads.
app.use(express.json())

---The req.body property contains key-value pairs of data submitted in the request body. By default,
it is undefined and is populated when you use a middleware called body-parsing such as express.urlencoded() or express.json(). 

router is an instance of the Express Router. It is a mini Express application that can be used to create modular, mountable route handlers. 
It allows you to organize your routes and middleware into separate modules.

const app = express();
Purpose:

app is an instance of the main Express application. It represents the entire Express application and is used to set up the middleware, 
routes, and other settings for the app.
Usage:

Typically used in the main entry file of the application (e.g., app.js or server.js).
Used to configure global middleware, set up the main routes, and listen on a specific port.

2) the error is solve(id:this.id) because i have used function rather than arrow function, 
arrow functions does not have their own "this" keyword
this inside an arrow function does not refer to the document instance but rather to the scope where the method was defined.
By using a regular function, this correctly points to the instance of the Mongoose document, 
allowing you to access the documentâ€™s properties such as _id and email. This is essential for schema methods in Mongoose to work correctly.

3)Error: secretOrPrivateKey must have a value
require('dotenv').config()
